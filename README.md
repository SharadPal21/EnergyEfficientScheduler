# Energy Efficient Scheduler

This project implements an **Energy-Efficient CPU Scheduling Algorithm** using Round Robin logic to minimize energy consumption.

## Features
 Prioritizes low-energy-consuming processes
 Introduces a low-power mode for idle CPU states
 Tracks total energy consumption per process

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/SharadPal21/EnergyEfficientScheduler.git
2. Navigate to the project folder: cd EnergyEfficientScheduler
3. Run the code: python scheduler.py
